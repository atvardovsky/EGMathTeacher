# EGMathTeacher Alatyr Help

Alatyr Core in this repository is used through assistant requests over the
installed Markdown adapter. It is not a shell command.

These aliases are chat/request shortcuts, not executable commands.

Full operation reference: `.ai/assistant/help-reference.md`.

Default routing:

- If the operation is clear and low risk, choose the matching operation and
  report the chosen route.
- If the request is unclear, show only the two or three closest operations and
  ask for the smallest missing decision.
- Use `.ai/assistant/context-router.json` to choose task context before
  expanding the reading set, and use `.ai/assistant/context-profiles.md` when
  human rationale or conflict resolution is needed.
- Use `.ai/assistant/module-profile.md` to avoid routing to blocked or
  disabled optional modules.

## Quick Operations

Operation: `help`
Use when: the user asks what Alatyr can do or the request is unclear.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/operation-routing.flow.md`
Minimum input: goal or suspected task area.

Operation: `product-change`
Alias: `alatyr-change`
Use when: accepted behavior, architecture, data, runtime, or public contract
may change.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/blueprint-driven-change.flow.md`
Minimum input: change intent, non-goals, and approval constraints.

Operation: `logical-integrity-review`
Alias: `alatyr-integrity`
Use when: code, docs, tests, diagrams, prompts, skills, gates, or bridges may
disagree.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/logical-integrity-review.flow.md`
Minimum input: changed fact, suspected drift, or files to inspect.

Operation: `create-project-blueprint`
Alias: `alatyr-blueprint`
Use when: creating, repairing, or rechecking blueprint-equivalent
source-of-truth docs from target evidence.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/project-blueprint-creation.flow.md`
Minimum input: blueprint scope and non-goals.

Operation: `recheck-after-framework-update`
Alias: `alatyr-recheck`
Use when: checking whether an Alatyr Core update requires target adapter
migration.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/adapter-recheck.flow.md`
Minimum input: update source or changed framework baseline.

AI infrastructure shortcuts:

- `alatyr-adaptation <source>`: route to `skill-adaptation` in review or
  adaptation mode.
- `alatyr-add-ai <source>`: route to `skill-adaptation` with canonical
  integration intent after inventory, provenance, prompt-injection, safety,
  and approval checks.

- `update Alatyr` or `обнови Alatyr`: `recheck-after-framework-update`
- `check Alatyr` or `проверь Alatyr`: `recheck-after-installation` or
