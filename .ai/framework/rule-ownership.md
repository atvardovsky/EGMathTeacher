# Rule Ownership

This file names the canonical owner for each Alatyr rule category.

Use it to reduce repeated policy text across README files, installer docs,
target templates, bridges, help files, and checkers. Owning documents contain
the rule meaning. Derived documents should reference the owner, rule ID, or
short summary instead of restating full policy.

The machine-readable ownership map lives in
`framework/rule-registry.json` under `category_owners`.

## Ownership Rules

- Full rule semantics belong in the owning framework document.
- Rule-owner framework documents must carry `alatyr_doc` front matter with a
  stable document ID, owned rule IDs, rule dependencies, and task-profile
  scope.
- `framework/rule-registry.md` and `framework/rule-registry.json` keep stable
  IDs, summaries, category owners, and migration metadata.
- Installer docs may summarize a rule only enough to route installation work.
- Target templates may contain placeholders and local adaptation prompts, but
  must not become portable rule owners.
- Bridge files must stay pointers to canonical target files, not policy
  copies.
- When a rule changes materially, update the owning document first, then the
  registry, affected templates, checkers, and changelog.

effectiveness reports.

## Change Protocol

When changing a rule category:

1. Update the owning framework document.
2. Update the owning document's `alatyr_doc` front matter when owned rules,
   dependencies, or task-profile scope change.
3. Update `framework/rule-registry.md` and
   `framework/rule-registry.json`.
4. Update derived installer docs, target templates, tools, or conformance
   data only when their contract changes.
5. Keep bridges as pointers.
6. Record behavior or contract changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
