# Context Router

The context router is the machine-readable companion to context profiles.

Context profiles remain the human-readable source for task routing rationale.
The router gives assistants and deterministic checks a compact map from task
profile to required context, expansion triggers, validation, approval, and
final evidence.

## Purpose

Use a context router to reduce repeated prose parsing before routine work.

A target adapter can load:

1. bootstrap context
2. `.ai/assistant/context-router.json`
3. the selected profile's required context

Then it expands only when the router or human profile names a boundary,
conflict, approval trigger, or missing source-of-truth fact.

## Router Contract

A target context router should define:

- schema version
- human reference file
- bootstrap context
- routing order
- canonical profile entries
- use-when signals
- required context paths
- expansion triggers
- approval gates
- validation or manual review
- final evidence

The router should use the same canonical profile names as
`context-profiles.md` unless the target adapter records a deliberate local
renaming.

## Ownership

The router is adapter-owned in a target repository. It must be rewritten from
target evidence before installation is accepted.

Framework core owns the router shape and canonical profile names, not concrete
target source files, commands, or policies.

## Markdown Relationship

The router does not replace Markdown context profiles. It narrows the first
routing decision.

When the router and Markdown profile disagree, the assistant should report
adapter drift and use the human-readable context profile as the explanation
surface until the target adapter repairs the conflict.

## Safety

The router must not be used to bypass:

- logical integrity review
- source-of-truth decisions
- approval records for protected changes
- target validation or unresolved validation evidence
- prompt-injection policy for imported AI infrastructure

If a task crosses a boundary not covered by the selected profile, expand
context and report why.
